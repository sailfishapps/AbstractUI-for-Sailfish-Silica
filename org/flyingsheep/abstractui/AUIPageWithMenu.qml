    //MENU HANDLING
    //Basic idea for abstracted menu handling inspired by THP
    //@ http://thpmaemo.blogspot.ch/2013/03/porting-harmattan-apps-to-sailfish.html
    //With the following differences:
    //1) simplified and condensed
    //2) we provide the ListView as a child of the Page, rather than expecting it to be passed from
    //the declaration of the AUIPage component

    //As this means every page would have a menu, even if not used or displayed
    //I have created two components
    //a) AUIPageWithMenu, which has menu handling
    //b) AUIPage, which has no menu
    //The two should be otherwise identical

    //This version uses a PushUpMenu, as that is closer to the Harmattan ToolBar / Menu idiom
    //Maybe in future versions of this control the user will be able to switch between PullDownMenu / PushUpMenu
    //Or we have to offer 2 versions. Food for thought here.

    id: thisPage
    objectName: "thisPage"
    property Item tools: null;
    property int orientationLock: AUIPageOrientation.Automatic

    property color backgroundColor: "white"
    AUIBackgroundRectangle {
        anchors.fill: parent
        color: parent.backgroundColor
        z: -9999
    }

    property alias menuitems: menuModel.children

    //not sure if we actually need these signals, it may be enough to pass on the menu.active property via alias
    //the stuff I am doing via the internal signal handlers could be done from onActiveChanged
    signal menuOpening()
    signal menuClosing()


    //Attempt to reparent childs of this page to the ListView, so they slide with the ListView when the menu opens
    //while the reparenting works, things don't slide as expected.
    //Even worse: If I have line below, and have an QtObject instance on my MainPage, I get the error:
    //"Cannot assign object to list"
    //    default property alias children: menuListView.children

    //http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5021350/how-do-you-assign-a-qml-item-to-a-component-property-in-qml-and-then-use-that-ob

    //As I have not got other childs to slide with the menu (but I am stil working on that..)
    //as a workaround I do the following:
    //a) increase the z: property of the ListView on opening, so it slides above other childs (and decrease it on
    //closing, otherwise the close menu steals mouse input!
    //b) and make other childs invisible while the menu is open.
    //Should this workaround (which is not bad in itself) have to become the permenant solution,
    //then several improvements can be made: e.g.
    //i) use transitions so the change is not so abrupt
    //ii) store current visibility in an array structure, so the same settings can be restored.
    //iii) maybe the childs can just be made "faint" rather than totally invisible ...

    //Rather than making invisible / visible, reducing and increasing the opacity works very well
    //this has the added benefit that I can just divide and multiply, and do not need to have an intermediate store
    //of the previous value

    //Possibly a final verison of this Control will have 3 behaviours for other childs (set by property)
    // 1: reduceOpacityOnMenuOpening
    // 2: invisibleOnMenuOpening
    // 3: slideAwayOnMenuOpening

    //If I use a SilicaFlickable (in place of the current ListView),

    //ListView allows me to drag down the menu, but the children reparented from the instance
    //do not drag down together with the menu as expected.
